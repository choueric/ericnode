Work as a software developer in embedded linux system with EE background.
Experience in developing linux kernel drivers for various peripheral devices
which are contained in SoC or individual chips communicating with SoC via buses
like I2C. In addition to the kernel part, daily work involves user-space
development in a varity of fileds, including network, video processing and GUI
programming etc.

Embrace open source and on [Github](https://github.com/choueric) host some side
projects, most of which are developed in Golang.
